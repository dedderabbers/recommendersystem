#Recommender system RPI 
My favourite movie is THE-WOLF-OF-WALL-STREET

The following files contain the SQL:

-RPI_Summary_recommendersystem - the output of this file = top50recommendations10.csv

-RPI_Title_recommendersystem - the output of this file = top50recommendations20.csv

-RPI_Starring_recommendersystem - the output of this file = top50recommendations30.csv

My movie is ranked in these files.

PythonCodeRPI.py is the python file.
I wrote comments in the file itself and whem I run it I can type my favorite movie name and it gives the average score.
After that it will make a csv called recommendations.csv
